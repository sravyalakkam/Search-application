This repository contains the back-end Java code of the project, built using Spring Boot. The project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates a product search feature with dynamic search and filtering options, alongside infinite scrolling. The back-end handles data retrieval and sorting from a MySQL database using Spring MVC. The front-end code, which is in a separate repository, is built with React and leverages state management and hooks for efficient data display. This project serves as a comprehensive example of integrating modern frontend and backend technologies.
